## faq

q: are u going to make your navbar more responsive?  
*a: no ,, LOL*  
follow-up: did you.. use an icon to avoid having to implement a hamburger menu?  
*a: ....*  
follow-up: don't u care about, like, consistency?? the sidebar and navbar don't match???  
*a: well.. you're not wrong .... but maybe i'll swap the navbar entirely to icons :eyes:*  

q: what do the dates mean?  
*a: dates are created (amigurumi) and posted (photo-journal). why? yeah, it's kind of a weird design choice. it's not like i really wanted this to be a blog in the first place, and i feel like i have the creative freedom to do.. well, whatever i want LOL. i expect photo-journal posts to be very erratic, while amigurumi posts will be more consistent (and need less backfill). i think the dual taken dates vs. posting dates make for an interesting (read: annoying) design that will confuse my friends HAHA.*  

q: why tf do you type like a teenager  
*a: i spend too much time on twitter lmao*
follow-up q: no way, your main is practically unused  
*a: yes that's true,, [alt accounts are very fun though, i recommend](http://twitter.com/paperskies_)*
